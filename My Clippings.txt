How did the Bodhisattva become a Buddha? If the essence of enlightenment is considered to be a state of realization, then in his final life the Bodhisattva transformed into a body of enlightenment, which is infinitely luminous. If the essence of enlightenment is considered to be a place, then he became enlightened in the form of an enjoyment body in the Gandavyuha Akanishta, or the realm of Buddha Vairochana.

A piece of driftwood that is soaking wet will not catch fire no matter how much it is rubbed. Just so, the body and the mind that are dowsed in desire are unable to reach liberation. Even if the driftwood is only moist this will still be the case. Just so, even if the body is kept apart from desire, if the mind is not kept apart, one remains unable to reach liberation. Only a dry stick is able to catch fire. Just so, body and mind must be well separated from desire.

Let us take offering water bowls as our example. You should give the bowls a good wipe. You must lay the bowls out in a straight line. They should not be too far apart, for that may result in your becoming separated from your guru. If they touch each other, you may become dull-witted. And if you put the bowls down noisily, you may become mad, and so on. Avoid doing these sorts of things. If you lay out the bowls while they are still empty, your merits will decline. Instead you should hold the stack of bowls in your hand and pour a little water into the top bowl. Consecrate this with the three syllables oṃ, āḥ, hūṃ. Pour most of the water from this bowl into the next, leaving a little behind. Put the first bowl on the altar and continue this process. In that way, you will not be putting empty bowls on your altar. When you fill the bowls on the altar, do not do disrespectful things like holding the water jug in only one hand. You must act as if you were pouring tea for a mahārāja.

Let us take offering water bowls as our example. You should give the bowls a good wipe. You must lay the bowls out in a straight line. They should not be too far apart, for that may result in your becoming separated from your guru. If they touch each other, you may become dull-witted. And if you put the bowls down noisily, you may become mad, and so on. Avoid doing these sorts of things. If you lay out the bowls while they are still empty, your merits will decline. Instead you should hold the stack of bowls in your hand and pour a little water into the top bowl. Consecrate this with the three syllables oṃ, āḥ, hūṃ. Pour most of the water from this bowl into the next, leaving a little behind. Put the first bowl on the altar and continue this process. In that way, you will not be putting empty bowls on your altar. When you fill the bowls on the altar, do not do disrespectful things like holding the water jug in only one hand. You must act as if you were pouring tea for a mahārāja.

As you breathe out, think, “I am breathing out.” Then as you breathe in, think, “I am breathing in.” Then think, “That is the first time.” Then do this a second time. Continue to number seven, eleven, fifteen, twenty-one, or whatever, but do not use your rosary to keep count. Do not get distracted from your counting. Ordinary beings cannot retain two things in the mind at once, and this is why the attachment and so on will subside, and the mind will change into a neutral state.
